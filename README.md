## Summary

Web interface for traccar server.

## Installation

1) Download latest build from http://ultrashare.ngrok.com/s/traccar-web/dev/latest/traccar-web.war

2) Stop Traccar service.

3) Replace `traccar-web.war` in Traccar installation folder (`/opt/traccar` or `c:\Program Files\Traccar`) with downloaded one. I recommend to do a backup of existing `traccar-web.war` just in case.

4) Start Traccar service

5) If necessary clear web browser cookies related to your traccar web UI. In chrome this can be done like said here http://superuser.com/questions/548096/how-can-i-clear-cookies-for-a-single-site

## Features

This project has following features, which don't exist in original `traccar-web` project:

* converted traccar-web to maven project to simplify builds
* following device
* printing device name
* recording device trace
* printing time stamps at device trace points (frequency is configured in Settings >> Preferences) both for archive and recorded trace
* translations to
  * russian language (available via ?locale=ru URL parameters)
  * german language (available via ?locale=de URL parameter)
  * italian language (available via ?locale=it URL parameter)
  * spanish language (available via ?locale=es URL parameter)
  * polish language (available via ?locale=pl URL parameter)
  * tagalog language (available via ?locale=tl URL parameter)
* show server log menu for viewing tracker-server.log file on Web
* speed filtering in archive view
* change default map center position, zoom (in Settings >> Preferences)
* replaced 'current state' panel with popups. They appear either when you hover a row in 'devices' table or when you hover a marker on map
* archive panel is collapsed by default. There is a button in upper right hand corner to expand it
* new 'managers' functionality: 
  * added new role to traccar - manager. Managers can add users and can manage access between devices of their users. So they have access to their devices and to devices of all managed users.
  * administrators have full access to everything. They can manage all devices, all users and access between devices and users
  * there is a new menu item called 'Share' to manage access to selected device
* improved performance of positions loading when DB grows up
* fixed issue when devices are not updated between different instances of web browser
* moved DB transaction management and user rights checks outside of data service implementation (AOP)
* possibility to detect 'offline' devices - when signal hasn't came for some time (set up in device settings). They will be shown on a map with a marker of different colour and there will be some sign in popup that they are actually offline.
* new device status - idle. It is shown in popup and also there will be a time of idling. Each device got new setting 'Idle when speed is <=', which is zero by default. It may be changed to some reasonable value, which is then used to consider device idle (for example to handle 'satelite drift compansation').
* possibility to restrict ordinary users to manage (i.e. add/edit/delete) devices. Configured in global application settings.


## Building

You can build it yourself easily without installing IDE (eclipse, idea, netbeans, etc.). The only requirement is installed Java Development Kit (JDK) v. 6 or greater:

1) Clone my repository

```
git clone https://github.com/vitalidze/traccar-web.git
```

2) Change to the cloned repo folder

```
cd traccar-web
```

3) Run build via maven wrapper

On Linux/Unix:

```
./mvnw package
```

On Windows:

```
mvnw package
```

Build can take several minutes. Once it completes the 'war' file will be under 'target' folder.

## Eclipse

Project can be set up in Eclipse.

#### Environment

Eclipse 4.3 with plugins:

  - m2e (a.k.a. Maven Integration for Eclipse (Juno and newer))
  - m2e-wtp (a.k.a. Maven Integration for Eclipse WTP (Juno))
  - google plugin for eclipse

#### Instructions

0) Clone repository:

    git clone https://github.com/vitalidze/traccar-web.git

1) Go to File >> Import project... Select Maven >> Existing Maven Projects and click 'Next'.
Then browse for a folder containing maven project. It should automatically find pom.xml file. Then click 'Next' to check maven goals or click finish.

2) In project's context menu select Google >> GWT Compile and unfold 'Advanced' section. Put '-war src/main/webapp' In 'Additional compiler arguments' section (this setting will is remembered for further compilations). Then hit 'Compile' button and wait until GWT compilation completes.

3) Run/Debug project. In project's context menu select Run as >> Web application.

#### Troubleshooting

* If you are getting "Main type not specified" then go to Run/Debug configuration settings (for example via Run >> Run Configurations... menu), select Web Application >> traccar.html and put `com.google.gwt.dev.DevMode` to the `Main class` field.

* If it complains about missing `src/test/java` folder then go to Project prefrences >> Java Build Path >> Source(tab) and remove `src/test/java` entry from source entries.
